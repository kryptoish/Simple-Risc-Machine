# RISC Machine Source Code for CPEN 211 CPU Competition

This repository contains the RISC machine source code used in the CPEN 211 CPU competition held at the end of the semester. 

## Performance Overview
- **Main Branch**: Achieves **maximum 5 cycles per instruction**. 
- **Competition Results**: Ranked **3rd place** in terms of:
  - Efficiency to compute a program.
  - Maximum clock frequency achieved.
  - Geometric Mean Speedup (compared to the unoptimized reference version).
- **Pipelined Branch**: An experimental version of the RISC machine with pipelining is available in the `pipelined` branch. Although not fully debugged, it is theoretically **2-3x faster** than the current implementation.

### Final Ranking and Scores

## Build Instructions
The RISC machine is developed with:
- **Quartus Prime 18.1**
- **ModelSim 10.5b**

It has been tested on the **Cyclone-V FPGA** using the **DE1-SoC** development board. While other Verilog tools and FPGAs may work, modifications to the top module and pin assignments may be required.

### Build Process
1. Add all `.sv` files to your project.
2. Set `lab7bonus_top` as your top module.
3. Create or modify `data.txt` to initialize system RAM.

## Important Note
This work is the property of **Krish Thakur** and **Warrick Lo**. It **MUST NOT** be copied or reused in any form. Furthermore, this code will no longer function on any version of the CPEN 211 autograder.
